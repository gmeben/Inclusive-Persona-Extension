# Inclusive Persona Extension

## Visual Disabilities (Blindness)

### Barriers to using the Web

* Cannot see. Cannot understand the visual information.
* Cannot use the Web without the text-to-speech feature (or braille output) of a screen reader.
* Cannot use fingers or major pointing devices like a mouse to click or tap on items.

### Solutions

* Provide alternative text for images and icons.
* Provide alternative formats such as audio descriptions for video content.
* Use "real" text rather than images of text.
* Mark up heading structures and landmarks appropriately.
* Make all functionality operable through a keyboard
* The link text and button label alone should convey the purpose of the link and button.
* Provide labels to identify form controls by using the `<label>` element.
* Make the data table structure as simple as possible and use the `<th>` element for table header cells.
* Use WAI-ARIA attributes and make sure a screen reader user is aware of dynamic context changes.
* Do not start playing any sounds automatically when the page is loaded.

## Visual Disabilities (Low Vision)

### Barriers to using the Web

* Cannot see well enough.
    * Cannot see clearly (Blurred vision, Double vision)
    * Glare sensitivity
    * Flickering eyesight
    * Peripheral vision loss
    * Central vision loss
    * Wandering eye (Shaky vision)
    * People with low vision might need screen readers depending on the severity.
* People with low vision might need screen readers depending on the severity.

### Solutions

* Allow users to enlarge content on the screen.
* Use "real" text rather than images of text.
* Provide adequate contrast between foreground text and its background color combinations.
* Make all keyboard-accessible components have a visible focus indicator.
* Make sure the information is transmitted correctly even if the color is changed to the opposite color by the user agent's function.
* Allow users to use a custom style sheet.
* Layout content in chunks to better facilitate flow of information.
* Follow familiar user interface design patterns.
* Do not change content with accidental triggers such as mouseover or keyboard focus.
* Match the screen readers reading order with the visual layout.

## Color-Blindness / Grayscale Print

### Barriers to using the Web

* Difficulty distinguishing between certain kinds of colors.
    * Protanopia / Protanomaly (Low or insensitivity to the color red)
    * Deuteranopia / Deuteranomaly (Low or insensitivity to the color green)
    * Tritanopia / Tritanomaly (Low or insensitivity to the color blue)
    * Monochromacy
* When printing a web page in grayscale, color-dependent information cannot be identified correctly.
* When opening a web page with a monochrome e-reader, color-dependent information cannot be identified correctly.

### Solutions

* Do not rely on color alone to communicate information.
    * Add an underline to the link (especially one in a sentence)
    * Express the visual hierarchy of text using non-color elements such as font size and thickness.
    * In figures (graphs, etc.), shapes other than colors should also be used as clues for visual identification.
* Make content understandable / usable even when displaying it in grayscale.

## Auditory Disabilities / In a public

### Barriers to using the Web

* Hard of hearing or total loss of hearing.
* Can't make sound in  a public space (transportation, library, etc.) including situations where  the battery of Bluetooth headphones is dead, forgot to bring headphones, etc.

### Solutions

* Provide transcripts for audio content.
* Provide captions (subtitles) for video content with audio.

## Motor Disabilities

### Barriers to using the Web

* Cannot use fingers or major pointing devices like a mouse to click or tap on items. Need to rely on the following means:
    - Adaptive / Customizable keyboards
    - Mouth stick
    - Various switch devices (or buttons)
    - Speech recognition software
    - Eye-controlled input devices
    - etc.
* Difficult to freely change the device orientation.

### Solutions

* Make all functionality operable through a keyboard.
* Make all keyboard-accessible components have a visible focus indicator.
* Make links, buttons, etc. large enough to be able to click / tap / execute without the need to perform precise pointing operations.
* Describe the labels of links and buttons clearly to support voice input. Write in text and mark up appropriately.
* Make sure that the page functions properly when the device is used in either "portrait" or "landscape" mode.

## Cognitive / Learning Disabilities

### Barriers to using the Web

* Difficult to recognize or memorize information.
* Easily distracted by sights and sounds in their environment.
* Difficult to read text (such as Dyslexia).

### Solutions

* Follow familiar user interface design patterns.
* Use plain language when presenting text-based information.
* Present headings to make it easier to understand the content overview. Use visual elements (images, figures, icons, symbols, etc.) to make content understandable without reading.
* Allow users a way to adjust the time or turn off the time limit if the content provides a time limit.
* Movement or blinking in the content should be limited within 5 seconds or allowed to be stopped by the user.
* Do not use flashes that flash 3 times or more per second in content expression.
* Do not start playing video and audio content automatically when the page is loaded.
* Use legible fonts.
* Make the font size and line spacing large enough to improve readability. Provide multiple means of contact. (e.g. text chat as well as phone calls)

## Aging

### Barriers to using the Web

* Difficult to use fingers or major pointing devices like a mouse precisely to click or tap on small items.
* Hard to read small and light text (Presbyopia).
* Hard of Hearing.
* Difficult to recognize information and hard to remember things.

### Solutions

* Make links, buttons, etc. large enough to be able to click / tap / execute without the need to perform precise pointing operations.
* Provide adequate contrast between foreground text and its background color combinations.
* Use “real” text rather than images of text.
* Make the font size and line spacing large enough to improve readability.
* Follow familiar user interface design patterns.
* Present headings to make it easier to understand the content overview.

## Mobile 

### Barriers to using the Web

* The field of view for obtaining information is narrow due to the small screen.
* Size of text tends to be small and difficult to read.
* When used outside, the content is difficult to see due to the glare of natural light.
* Since it is tapped on with a finger, precise pointing is difficult compared to using a mouse.
* Typing is more troublesome than using a hardware keyboard.
* Mouse-based interactions (such as mouseovers) are not available.

### Solutions

* Clarify content priorities from a user experience perspective and structure information serially based on those priorities.
* Make the font size and line spacing large enough to improve readability. 
* Allow users to enlarge content on the screen.
* Provide adequate contrast between foreground text and its background color combinations.
* Make links, buttons, etc. large enough to be able to tap without the need to perform precise pointing operations.
* Minimize the frequency of text input (typing).
* Do not implement mouseover-dependent interactions.
